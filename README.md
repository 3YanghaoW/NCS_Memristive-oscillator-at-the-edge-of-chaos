Memristive oscillator at the edge of chaos enables controllable complex behaviors and frequency domain extraction

## Overview
These codes provides the local active VO_2 devices analysis and its controllable complex behaviors and frequency domain extraction in both experiments and simualtions.

## Software Requirements
MATLAB R_2022b, Python 3.7

## Demo
The "30 1.5m.csv" is the experiment data of the VO_2 device in bidirectional static IV sweep from 0-1.5 mA under 30 degrees Celsius temperature.

The "ivsweep.m" is the model simulation code for device.

The "plotvector.m" is the simple local active analysis for the device.

The "mymodeloscillation.m" is the simulated oscillation behavior of the device.

The "inject_before_after.m" is the visualization of the original injection signal and the device-filtering signal.

The "preprocess.ipynb" is the alignment preprocess for original audio data.

The "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15240659" contains the original data for classification. X data means the input, Y data means the label.
